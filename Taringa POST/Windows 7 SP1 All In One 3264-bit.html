Windows 7 Starter is only available in a 32-bit version. The Windows  Aero theme is not included in this version. The desktop wallpaper and  Visual Styles (Windows 7 Basic) are not user-changeable. Its functions  are very limited. Microsoft originally intended to restrict the edition  to running 3 simultaneous applications, but this limitation was dropped.  This edition is available pre-installed on computers, especially  netbooks, through system integrators or computer manufacturers using OEM  licences.<br />       <br />                       <b>Windows 7 Home Basic</b><br />       <br />                     **********************<br />       <br />                       <img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://eih.bz/s0/02hbasic.jpg" /><br />       <br />                       Windows  7 Home Basic is available in emerging markets such as Argentina,  Brazil, Chile, the People's Republic of China, Colombia, India,  Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, Mexico, Russia, Thailand, and Turkey. It  is not available in developed technology markets countries including in  Western and Central Europe, North America, Hong Kong, Australia and  Saudi Arabia. Some Aero options are excluded along with several new  features. Home Basic, along with other editions sold in emerging  markets, include geographical activation restriction, which requires  users to activate Windows within a certain region<br />       <br />                     or country.<br />       <br />                       <b>Windows 7 Home Premium</b><br />       <br />                     **********************<br />       <br />                       <img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://eih.bz/s0/03hprefff.jpg" /><br />       <br />                       This  edition contains features aimed at the home market segment, such as  Windows Media Center, Windows Aero and multi-touch support.<br />       <br />                       <b>Windows 7 Professional</b><br />       <br />                     **********************<br />       <br />                       <img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://eih.bz/s0/04pro.jpg" /><br />       <br />                       This  edition is targeted towards enthusiasts and small-business users. It  includes all the features of Windows 7 Home Premium, and adds the  ability to participate in a Windows Server domain. Additional features  include operating as a Remote Desktop server, location aware printing,  Encrypting File System, Presentation Mode, Software Restriction Policies  (but not the extra management features of AppLocker) and Windows XP  Mode. Like Enterprise, Microsoft will support this edition until 2020.<br />       <br />                       <b>Windows 7 Enterprise</b><br />       <br />                     **********************<br />       <br />                       <img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://eih.bz/s0/05enterpri.jpg" /><br />       <br />                       This  edition targets the enterprise segment of the market and is sold  through volume licensing to companies which have a Software Assurance  contract with Microsoft. Additional features include support for  Multilingual User Interface (MUI) packages, BitLocker Drive Encryption,  and UNIX application support. Not available through retail or OEM  channels, this edition is distributed through Microsoft Software  Assurance (SA). As a result it includes several SA-only benefits,  including a license allowing the operating of diskless nodes (diskless  PCs), the running of multiple virtual machines, and activation via VLK.  Like Professional, Microsoft will support this edition until 2020.<br />       <br />                       <b>Windows 7 Ultimate</b><br />       <br />                     **********************<br />       <br />                       <img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://eih.bz/s0/06ultimate.jpg" /><br />       <br />                       Windows  7 Ultimate contains all of the same features as Windows 7 Enterprise,  but unlike the Enterprise edition, it is available to home users on an  individual license basis. Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows 7  Professional users are able to upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate for a fee  using Windows Anytime Upgrade if they wish to do so. Unlike Windows  Vista Ultimate, the Windows 7 Ultimate edition does not include the  Windows Ultimate Extras feature or any exclusive features as Microsoft  had stated. However, even though it is the consumer equivalent to  Enterprise, Microsoft will only support Ultimate until 2015, as per Home  Premium.<br />       <br />       <img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://eih.bz/s0/faxcool.png" /><br />   dijo:<br />&quot;<b>N</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>E</b>&quot; editions<br /><br />                <u><b>E</b> editions</u><br />       <br />                     The  features in the E Editions are the same as their equivalent full  versions, but do not include Internet Explorer.

This is an important update that includes previously released  security, performance, and stability updates for Windows 7. SP1 also  includes new improvements to features and services in Windows 7, such as  improved reliability when connecting to HDMI audio devices, printing  using the XPS Viewer, and restoring previous folders in Windows Explorer  after restarting.<br />       <br />                     Windows 7 Service Pack 1 is an update that does the following :<br />       <br />                       - Helps keep PCs supported.<br />       <br />                     -  Provides ongoing improvement to the operating system, by including  previous updates delivered over Windows Update as well as continuing  incremental updates to the Windows 7 platform based on customer and  partner feedback.<br />       <br />                     - Makes it easy for organizations to deploy a single set of updates.<br />       <br />                       <b><u>Changes specific to Windows 7</u></b><br />       <br />                       <b>Additional support for communication with third-party federation services</b><br />       <br />                     Additional  support has been added to allow Windows 7 clients to effectively  communicate with third-party identity federation services (those  supporting the WS-Federation passive profile protocol). This change  enhances platform interoperability, and improves the ability to  communicate identity and authentication information between  organizations.<br />       <br />                       <b>Improved HDMI audio device performance</b><br />       <br />                     A  small percentage of users have reported issues in which the connection  between computers running Windows 7 and HDMI audio devices can be lost  after system reboots. Updates have been incorporated into SP1 to ensure  that connections between Windows 7 computers and HDMI audio devices are  consistently maintained.<br />       <br />                       <b>Corrected behavior when printing mixed-orientation XPS documents</b><br />       <br />                     Prior  to the release of SP1, some customers have reported difficulty when  printing mixed-orientation XPS documents (documents containing pages in  both portrait and landscape orientation) using the XPS Viewer, resulting  in all pages being printed entirely in either portrait or landscape  mode. This issue has been addressed in SP1, allowing users to correctly  print mixed-orientation documents using the XPS Viewer.<br />       <br />        <br />How to install :<br /><br />                **************<br />       <br />                       - Extract using WinRAR.<br />       <br />                     - Use ImgBurn** to burn the extracted ISO file called &quot;faXcooL.Windows.7.SP1.ENG.x86-x64.ACTiVATED&quot;<br />       <br />                     * You can use any other software for this operation (Nero, Alcohol, CloneCD...)<br />       <br />                     * Burning speed should not be faster than 4x.<br />       <br />                     - Restart your computer*.<br />       <br />                     * You can install it from existing OS, but I'll recommend the clean installation.<br />       <br />                     - Make sure you've seleceted your DVD-ROM/RW drive as a first boot device (BIOS setup)*<br />       <br />                     * If you don't know how to do that, check this link <a href="http://www.hiren.info/pages/bios-boot-cdrom" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.hiren.info/pages/bios-boot-cdrom</a><br />       <br />                     - The text message will appear &quot;Press any key to boot from CD or DVD....&quot;<br />       <br />                     * By pressing the key you're entering the setup.<br />       <br />                     - Select your language, time and currency and keyboard input (optionaly)<br />       <br />                     - Click &quot;Install now&quot;.<br />       <br />                     - Choose your edition* (x86 is 32-bit, x64 is 64-bit) depending of CPU type you have.<br />       <br />                     * Note that if you have less than 4GB of RAM, x64 will be useless.<br />       <br />                     - Click &quot;I accept&quot;.<br />       <br />                     - Click &quot;Custom (advanced).<br />       <br />                     - Choose your partition/hdd drive where Win7 should be installed and click format.<br />       <br />                     * Setup will continue automaticly and it will finish after 15-30 min.<br />       <br />                     - Next step will be username (Image 17).<br />       <br />                     - Type your password (if you want).<br />       <br />                     - Choose the third option for next step.<br />       <br />                     - Select your time zone.<br />       <br />                     - Select your current location.<br />       <br />                     - And the last step will be silent auto-activation*<br />       <br />                     * Your PC will restart for the last time.<br />       <br />                       And that would be all about installation.
