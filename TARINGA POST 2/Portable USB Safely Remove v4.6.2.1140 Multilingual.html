Using this menu you can find and stop a device in a snap!<br /><br />After you have stopped a device but did not unplug it, sometimes it is quite useful to return it back into the system. For example, if you remembered that you forgot to write a file to an external drive. In order to do it, you have to physically reconnect the device, however sometimes it's quite inconvenient to do, e.g. if the device is connected to the rear panel of the computer.<br /><br /><b>Here are some key features of &quot;USB Safely Remove&quot;:</b><br /> Safely remove in one click!<br /> Displaying processes which are preventing USB device from being stopped<br /> Powerful command line support<br /> 3 methods to stop devices.<br /> Automatically assigning hotkeys.<br /> Forbidding stopping any device.<br /> Customizable names and descriptions for devices.<br /> Notifications about connecting/disconnecting devices with the help of a balloon tooltip.<br /> Playing sounds or running external programs when devices are connecteddisconnected.<br /> Restricting access to the features of the program with a password.<br /> Loading custom images for devices<br /> Ability to operate SATA drives.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center"><img class="imagen" border="0" src="http://i4.fastpic.ru/big/2011/0128/86/067afa4ea4e0aefdfed0c61f57a2ca86.jpg" /></div><br /><br /><b>OS: </b>Win 2000XP2003VistaWin7, 3264 bit.<br /><b>Language: </b>Multilingual<br /><b>License: </b>Free (portable)<br /><b>Size: </b>5.22 Mb<br /><br /><b>Download:</b><br /><a href="http://vip-file.com/downloadlib/979288884821062877-10538.1f37f890e9a262a6bed9953ceecc/Portable_USB_Safely_Remove_v4.6.2.1140.zip.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://vip-file.com/downloadlib/979288884821062877-10538.1f37f890e9a262a6bed9953ceecc/Portable_USB_Safely_Remove_v4.6.2.1140.zip.html</a>								</span>
